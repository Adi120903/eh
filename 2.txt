Aim :- Use Crypt Tool to encrypt and decrypt passwords using RCH alogrithm
adit
steps:-
1) Download and install CryptTool
2) Open CryptTool and replace the text.
We will encrypt the following phrase;
"My name is anonymous"
We will use 00 00 00 as the encryption key.
Open CryptTool.
Replace the text with phrase given above itself.

3) Encrypt the text.
-Click on Encrypt/Decrypt menu.
-Point to symmetric (modern)then select RC4

4) select Encryption key
-Select 24 bits as the encryption key.
-Set the value to 00 0000.
-Click on Encrypt button.
-You will get the following stream Cipher.

5) Start Analysis
-Click on Analysis menu.
-Point to symmetric Encryption (modern) then select RC4
-Remeber the assumption made is the secret key is 24bits so make sure you select 24 bits as the key length.
-Click on the start button.

6) Analysis the results
-When the analysis is complete you will the results.
-Select the line that makes the most click on Accept selection button when done.
